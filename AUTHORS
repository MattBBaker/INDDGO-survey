The INDDGO software was originally developed by Blair D. Sullivan, 
Chris Groer, and Dinesh Weerapurage at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 

The current functionality provided by INDDGO would not be possible without significant additional development 
and major contributions from several other researchers at ORNL (listed alphabetically): 
Matthew Baker 
Joshua Lothian 
Sarah Powers 
Jonathan Schrock 

The developers gratefully acknowledge the support of the Department of Energy, Office of Science, 
Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research, under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 with Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory and the GRAPHS program of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). 
This work was also supported in part by the United States Department of Defense and used resources 
of the Extreme Scale Systems Center at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
