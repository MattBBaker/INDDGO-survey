Pre-requisites for INDDGO:
  - For parallel versions:
    - an MPI compiler (tested with OpenMPI and Cray MPI)
    - a C++ compiler capable of compiling OpenMP code (tested with GCC >= 4.4.3)

  - For building versions with MADNESS:
    - autoconf
    - automake

Configuration:
  To configure INDDGO, a make.inc file must be created, containing
  the various options for compilers and optional software packages.

  We provide two example files, make.inc.paralle and make.inc.serial
  to get you started.  Simply copy one of these files to make.inc.
  Next, edit it and set the "SRC_DIR" variable to the directory where
  you unpacked INDDGO. 
  
  Various HAS_<PACKAGENAME> variables may be set.  If set, you must also
  set the corresponding directory variable further on in the make.inc.

  We provide a copy of the MADNESS runtime library, however other
  dependencies must be installed manually.

  For details on where to obtain optional dependencies and their required
  versions, see the thirdparty.txt file.

Compilation:
  To compile INDDGO, follow these steps:

make deps
make

  Resulting binaries will be places in SRC_DIR/bin.  INDDGO also provides
  various non-default binaries that may be built for testing purposes.
  These will be placed in the appropriate sub-package's /bin directory.
