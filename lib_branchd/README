This code is deprecated, and incompatible with the current lib_graphd. It was written using a previous version of the graph decomposition library. Most functionality should be re-attainable, but new GraphEOUtil classes, etc need to be incorporated into the code. Please contact the developers if you are interested in helping with this - the header files for the old Graph classes can be made available for reference.
